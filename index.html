                    <p>As a person, my interest is to act with a balance of proper manners, efficiency, honesty and enjoyment for as many as possible. However I distance myself from crowds as it is tiresome for me.</p>

                    <p>As for treating myself, I focus on self improving abilities and behavior in any and all subjects I interact with. I have a wide aspect of interests and believe almost anything can have a use in it's own way.</p>

                    <p> I can be slow at starting up but stay focused once I have a set goal, I prefer to work as long as I can when I get started and don't normally like breaks if I'm in action. Am very focused on things being done right.</p>
